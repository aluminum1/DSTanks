2 player tank game based on 1st order differential equations.

For now: player 1 has been created. Arrow keys to move around, space to fire, right shift to reverse orientation of cannon.

To do: 

* create player 2 (to make a 2 player game running on a single computer), with firing, collision detection.

* Different levels = different background ODE's.

* chalk effect for firing and chalk track for cannon balls.

* background = chalkboard? Or... "smeared out" vector field (i.e. "convoluted" vector field on a fixed background?)

Possible future?

* upgrade to make it a 2 player game over network (proably use peer-to-peer architecture? peer.js)

* upgrade to allow for up to 4 players over network
